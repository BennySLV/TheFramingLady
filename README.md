Motivation

The main purpose of this project to help enchance both my web design and web development skills, as well as enhancing my overall project portfolio. Additionally this project was done to help me create a website from start to finish. Simulating a business-style project for a client. 

Installation

Please note that no framework has been used to develop this project so far. Currently to therefore access the project, you just need to download/clone the project.

However, it would be useful to set up your own virtual host on your chosen web-server stack (ideally, LAMP/MAMP/WAMP/XAMPP, etc). You will also need to create a database on your web server. This is to access the PHP and MySQL data.
