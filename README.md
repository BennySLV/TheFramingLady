<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Please note that no framework has been used to develop this project so far. Currently to therefore access the project, you just need to download/clone the project.</p>

<p>However, it would be useful to set up your own virtual host on your chosen web-server stack (ideally, LAMP/MAMP/WAMP/XAMPP, etc). You will also need to create a database on your web server. This is to access the PHP and MySQL data.</p>
